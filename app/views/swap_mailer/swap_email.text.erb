Hi <%= @gifter.name %>

The moment you all have been waiting for has finally arrived:  The first annual Grunow/Kuhlmann sock swap. 
The limit is $15 and the only rule is to just have fun with it!  
You folks get out there and start your shopping, 
so by the time you get to SC, you'll be ready to do some swapping.
  
YOUR SECRET GIFTEE IS <%= @giftee.name %>

This is the person you will be getting socks for.  
Please do not reveal this name to anyone. 
The exchange will take place in Charleston.

Merry Christmas to all!
